                                    I finished my Grade school at Meridian International Learning Experience.
                                    I studied there for eight years before being transferred to UPIS.
                                    UPIS (University of the Philippines Integrated School) is where I had the opportunity of studying as a varsity student. 
                                    Four years after and I graduated class of 2015. My choice of entering which college was no brainer since my heart already fell for UP ‚ù§ Now I am third year high school studying in UP Diliman!

                                    Besides swimming or going to the gym. I love to watch k-drama and many tv series.
                                    I would watch all day everyday when I have my free time.
                                    My other hobbies are going to the mall with my friends or eating somewhere and trying a new restaurant!

                                    I‚Äôve been swimming for more than ten years now and swimming has been my top skill ever since. 
                                    I am very athletic and I‚Äôve been joining different competitions since I was 9 years old until now. 
                                    Besides swimming, I love to run. I do 10k run on a normal day during weekends because this has been my stress reliever ever since.
