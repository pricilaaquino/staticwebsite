                    <p class="lead">Caution Hot is one of the restauranst in Maginhawa that never runs out of customers. We would always have to wait in line because that's how in demand their ramen is! But when you get there, I promise you it is worth the wait. They offer different Ramens, there is only one classic (if you are not the spicy type) then tehre are the spicy ramens and there are levels of spiciness. I also try their favorite milktea here that goes well with the Ramen.  </p>
