The line is always worth the wait because of their affordable beef nachos, quesedillas, and burritos. My friends and I would order only beef nachos and a burrito and we're already really full sometimes, even with leftovers! So if you're really really hungry and want to besomewhere that fits your budget, this is the place! </p>
